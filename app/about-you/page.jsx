      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-burgundy-500 mb-4">Dear Maria,</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I don't know if I can ever fully express how much I appreciate you and
        everything you ve done for me, but I want to try.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You've helped me in ways I didn't even know I needed. Even in the
        limited time we've been talking again (a year is a lot tbf), You helped
        me through so many problems in life. There's so much about you that
        makes you special, and I'm lucky to have you in my life. You've been the
        person I could always turn to, the one I could be honest with, the one I
        could share everything with. It's not always easy to find someone who
        meshes with you on a such a level, and even less easy to find someone
        who listens with the kind of kindness and understanding that you do,
        rarer is to get some that shares their own life and is willing to work
        through every misstep you make.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We've talked about each other's pasts, our struggles, and everything in
        between. Through it all, you've remained as much of yourself as you can
        be. Not only that, You're smart, thoughtful and the kindest soul I know.
        Sometimes you can be the most emotionally mature person I know, and
        sometimes you can be delightfully immature - but honestly, that's part
        of what makes you so imperfectly perfect in my eyes, in the way your
        "flaws" are themselves things that I can adore
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The way you work, the way you think, the way you live your life - it's
        all so impressive. You give your degree more than you probably need to,
        and I know you're doing it because you want to prove yourself to
        yourself. I get that, I do. But I just wish you would go easy on
        yourself sometimes. You work so hard, too hard, and you deserve to cut
        yourself a little slack now and then.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You have this distinct mark on everything you do. Your hobbies, what you
        like, the way you think about things, the way you communicate, the way
        you approach life - it all feels like it has a piece of you in it; more
        than I have ever seen in anyone. And it's the most beautiful thing.
        You're the most independently independent person I know, and your
        essence is unlike anyone else's. There's just something about you that
        makes you stand out in the best possible way; wish I had better words to
        put it more clearly but you inspire me to be myself just by being the
        way you are.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You deserve all the good things life has to offer, and I hope you get
        everything you want from that bitch. You're one of a kind, and I am so
        grateful to know you.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8 text-right">Take care of yourself, always.</p>
      <p className="text-right">With all my heart,</p>
      <p className="text-right font-bold">Abuzar</p>
